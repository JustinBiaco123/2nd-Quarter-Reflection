        <p>"As technology grows, new doors it shows, paving the way where no one knows." The advancement of our technology has brought a lot of things that can be used to our own advantage, and programming language is one of the things time has brought us. As my journey in grade 9 continues, I discovered more things about ICT and coding to be specific.</p> <br> <br>

        <p>In this quarter, I learned what CSS is, why we should use it, its importance and its uses in our daily life. I learned how div and span tags work and that they can be useful in applying styles in my webpage, I also learned the difference between block-level elements and inline-level elements, I discovered how classes work in CSS and its definition, and the different types of pseudo-classes and how they can help in modifying webpages. Typography can be used in improving the visual appearance of texts whether inside or outside a website. And finally, I learned how the box model can keep our webpage clean and organized, element positioning as well, can help in object placements, floating images can help us to make our images appearance improve and backgrounds can help in the overall appearance of our webpage as it removes the dullness of a white background.</p> <br> <br>

        <p>All in all, this quarter made me realize how important and useful CSS is, and we should use it to our own advantage to create things that can help us. I can also say that I understand our lessons in ICT for this quarter.</p> <br> <br>
